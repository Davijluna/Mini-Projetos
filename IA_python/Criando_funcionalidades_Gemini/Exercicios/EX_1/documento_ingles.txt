Literature is a vast universe of words, stories, and emotions that transports us to different eras, cultures, and perspectives. It emerges as a form of human expression, reflecting the feelings, struggles, and achievements of a society. From the epics of Antiquity, such as Homer's *Iliad* and *Odyssey*, to modern novels like Miguel de Cervantes' *Don Quixote* or Guimarães Rosa's *Grande Sertão: Veredas*, literature uniquely shapes and documents the human experience.

Beyond being a reflection of its time, literature also challenges us to think and question the world around us. It can be social criticism, as in George Orwell's *1984*, a reflection on human nature, as in Dostoevsky's *Crime and Punishment*, or a dive into universal themes, such as love and death, present in so many classic and contemporary authors. The richness of literature lies in its ability to provoke reflection and empathy, offering a profound and pluralistic view of the human condition.
